Self Reflection- Bibhas:

It was a wonderful exercise and specially got to explore data structures and List and Dictionary. The fact that we could not use any system methods made it very interesting. As for the task distribution, we took a stab at all problems but also assigned an owner for Problem 3, 4 , 5 and 6 and the same was added as a comment in the code so team members could take ownership of their problems. 1 and 2 were relatively simple so we just chose the solution which was checked in first.

Self Reflection- Kirti:

I really got "re-hooked" to coding. And the more i was doing excercises, more i wanted to experiment. But due to deadlines, wasnt able to experiment much. Luckily, I was assigned Problem 4 and in end did problem 3 as well. This was great to again use brute force logic in both the problems. I took stab on 1 and 2 as well and relatively 1 and 2 were simpler. I know that i am going to learn more on MVC as well as follow the book "Freeman".
