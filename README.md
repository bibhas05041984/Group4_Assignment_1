Self Reflection- Bibhas:

It was a wonderful exercise and specially got to explore data structures and List and Dictionary. The fact that we could not use any system methods made it very interesting. As for the task distribution, we took a stab at all problems but also assigned an owner for Problem 3, 4 , 5 and 6 and the same was added as a comment in the code so team members could take ownership of their problems. 1 and 2 were relatively simple so we just chose the solution which was checked in first.
