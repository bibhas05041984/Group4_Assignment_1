Submission
Push the code to GitHub and submit the URL. Also, get the output from a sample run that shows the use of all required methods, take a screenshot and upload/push it to GitHub. To help the instructor calibrate the difficulty of the questions, please add a self-reflection as a comment to the submission. In the self-reflection, please indicate the time you spent on the assignment, and what you found most and least useful about the assignment. Any suggestions for future assignments are especially welcome.

Self Reflection- Bibhas:

It was a wonderful exercise and specially got to explore data structures like List and Dictionary. The fact that we could not use any system methods made it very interesting.I had to spend a lot of time for the first time I had to work with getting inputs from the user and thereafter, It was easier to do the same for the rest of the problems. As for the task distribution, we took a stab at all problems but also assigned an owner for Problem 3, 4 , 5 and 6 and the same was added as a comment in the code so team members could take ownership of their problems. 1 and 2 were relatively simple so we just chose the solution which was checked in first.

Self Reflection- Kirti:

I really got "re-hooked" to coding. And the more i was doing excercises, more i wanted to experiment. But due to deadlines, wasnt able to experiment much. Luckily, I was assigned Problem 4 and in end did problem 3 as well. This was great to again use brute force logic in both the problems. I took stab on 1 and 2 as well and relatively 1 and 2 were simpler. I know that i am going to learn more on MVC as well as follow the book "Freeman".

Self Reflection - Avie: 

Intresting exercise, a bit confused on how it's all applicable to Data Analytics - however; the API connection was interesting, in the context of connecting to pre-existing data and utilzing it in a web development space. Looking forward to seeing how this all connects throughout the program. 

Self Reflection - Laura:

I struggled with this exercise a lot and I had to learn from scratch. Even though I spend a lot of time in SQL, I am struggling in this class. It is my first time in a real programming class. My fellow group members had to be patient with me as I felt like I was dragging them down a bit. I hope that I can understand more as we get more into the html side because I have more experience in that in my previous life. I liked seeing the results of the programs but I am looking forward to the next stuff that is more visual. Assignment 1 & 2 was easier to do, but I got stuck at the last minute with my assignment.
