                Professor Agrawal receives an array of integer points sorted in ascending order, the task is to find the initial
                and final index of a given target point’s value.
                If the target point value is not found in the array of integers, return [-1, -1]
                The professor had to leave for a conference at short notice and asked you to complete the task for him.He instructed you to
                limit the time complexity to O(n).
                Example 1:
                Input:  marks = [5, 6, 6, 9, 9, 12]  target = 9
                Output: [3,4]
                Example 2: 
                Input: marks = [5, 6, 6, 9, 9, 12] target = 10
                Output:[-1,-1]

                Note: The algorithm’s runtime complexity must be O(n).*/

               Rocky is not aware of the inbuilt functions to split and reverse a string. He is given a string and he needs to
               reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.
               He is not allowed to use any predefined split and reverse function. He is requesting you to complete the method for him.

            /*Question 3: 
                Professor Stablein is given a sorted integer array. He needs to make the array elements distinct by increasing each
                value as needed, while minimizing the array sum. Professor Stablein thought this was an interesting exercise that the
                students might enjoy completing. Your job is to complete the method to print the minimum possible sum as output.
                Example : 
                Input : arr[] = {2,2,3,5,6};			Output: 20
                Explanation: Array is transformed to {2,3,4,5,6}. Sum becomes 2+3+4+5+6=20
                Input arr[]= {40,40};				Output: 81
                Explanation: Array is transformed to {40,41}. Sum becomes 81
                Input: arr[] = {4,5,6,9};			Output : 24
                Explanation: As the array is sorted and has distinct elements. So result is sum of each elements in the array.

                You are given a string and your task is to sort the given string in decreasing order of frequency of occurrence of each character.

            /*Question 5: 
                Rocky the Bull is new to programming and is having trouble understating the importance of time complexity.
                Professor Agrawal assigned you the job of explaining time complexity to Rocky with the example below.
                Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

                Example 1:
                Input: nums1 = [2,5,5,2], nums2 = [5,5]
                Output: [5,5]

                Example 2:
                Input: nums1 = [3,6,2], nums2 = [6,3,6,7,3]
                Output: [3,6]

                Note:
                Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
                The result can be in any order.
                Submit 2 Solutions where time complexity of the methods is be less than O(n^2). 

                Hint1: You can sort the both arrays and then compute the intersection, in this way you will achieve a
                time complexity of O(n log n). 
                Hint2: If you make use of a dictionary, you need not sort the arrays to compute the intersection. The time complexity in
                this case will be O(n).

                You are given an array of characters and an integer k, and are required to find out whether there are two distinct
                indices i and j in the array such that arr[i]=arr[j] and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.
                Example 1: 
                Input: arr=[a,g,h,a], k=3
                Output= true
                Explanation= arr[0] and arr[3] contains “a”; hence the absolute difference between 0 and 3 is 3 which is equal to 3
                therefore output is true.
                Example 2: arr=[k,y,k,k], k=1
                Output= true
                Example 3: 
                Input: arr=[a,b,c,a,b,c], k=2
                Output: false
                Explanation= arr[0]=arr[3] but absolute difference is not at most 2 
                           arr[1]=arr[4] but absolute difference is not at most 2
                           arr[2]=arr[5] but absolute difference is not at most 2
                           There fore output is false.

                Note: The algorithm’s runtime complexity must be in the order of O(n).
                Hint : You can make use of a dictionary to obtain the required time complexity.
